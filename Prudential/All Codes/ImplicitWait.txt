The implicit wait will tell to the web driver to wait for certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception". 
The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, web driver will wait for that time before throwing an exception.

Syntax:
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Code:
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS);
